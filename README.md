Record Rendezvous – E‑Commerce API

Record Rendezvous is a Spring Boot–based RESTful API for an online record store. This project was developed as Capstone 3 for the Year Up United Java / Code Academy program, focusing on backend development, REST principles, authentication, and database integration.

The API supports user authentication, product management, categories, and secure access using JWT tokens. It is designed to serve as the backend for an existing web storefront.
